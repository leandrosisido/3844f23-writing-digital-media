Maybe you're tempted to delete the opening paragraph that you've already written and start a new one, but you're scared that the new paragraph won't be quite as brilliant as it seems in your head.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a version control system like Git, you would be able to save the current version of the essay, create another version of the essay with the seemingly brilliant new opening paragraph, and compare them. If you ended up liking the version with the new opening paragraph better, you could easily merge it into the main version of the essay. Even if you changed your mind the next day, you could still revert back to the version with the original opening paragraph. All the changes and updates would be carefully tracked and easily navigable.\n",
